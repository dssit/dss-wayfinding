  # track_devices
  #
  #   Helps track active sessions/devices based on IP address, whether or not
  #   the device is being used in kiosk mode, and the origin/start location.
  #   Does so by updating the updated_at column for existing devices whenever a
  #   request is received and by creating new records for new devices.
  #
  #   Potential issues: New devices might not have room numbers, so two records
  #   might be created for a new device: One without a start location and one
  #   with.
  #

    # Possibilities for current device's visitor state:
    # 1. The kiosk is waiting for a new visitor. Neither start nor end are set.
    # See #3.
    # 2. The kiosk is currently being used by a visitor. Start is set, but not
    # end. Don't need to do anything.
    # 3. The kiosk just finished being used by a visitor. End is set (start is,
    # too). Create a new visitor. Start will be set when someone clicks on
    # something (i.e., there was no request for logvisitor recently)
